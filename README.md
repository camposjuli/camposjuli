## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my profile! 🐞I´m Juliana Campos

I work as a Software Quality Analyst at Senior Sistemas.

:white_check_mark: I’m currently learning: Web test automation and tools to improve testing efficiency.

:white_check_mark: I’m looking to collaborate on: Quality assurance projects, especially involving automation for web applications.

:white_check_mark: I’m looking for help with: Advanced test automation frameworks and best practices in CI/CD pipelines.

:dart: I am currently taking the QA Career track at Alura, where I am deepening my theoretical and practical knowledge in software quality assurance. The course covers foundational QA concepts, such as test planning and bug management, as well as technical skills like programming in JavaScript, using Git and GitHub, and test automation with tools like Cypress and Robot Framework. I am also learning about agile methodologies, continuous integration with GitHub Actions, creating and testing APIs with Node.js, and implementing unit and integration tests. This learning experience is preparing me to develop automated solutions that ensure the efficiency and quality of systems in my work environment.
